<h2>Foreword</h2>
</div>


<p>During World War II the photographers of the United States armed forces
created on film a pictorial record of immeasurable value. Thousands
of pictures are preserved in the photographic libraries of the armed
services but are little seen by the public.</p>

<p>In the narrative volumes of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II, now
being prepared by the Office of the Chief of Military History of the
United States Army, it is possible to include only a limited number
of pictures. Therefore, a subseries of pictorial volumes, of which
this is one, has been planned to supplement the other volumes of the
series. The photographs have been especially selected to show important
terrain features, types of equipment and weapons, living and weather
conditions, military operations, and matters of human interest. These
volumes will preserve and make accessible for future reference some
of the best pictures of World War II. An appreciation not only of the
terrain upon which actions were fought, but also of its influence on
the capabilities and limitations of weapons in the hands of both our
troops and those of the enemy, can be gained through a careful study of
the pictures herein presented. These factors are essential to a clear
understanding of military history.</p>

<p>This book deals with the European Theater of Operations, covering the
period from the build-up in the United Kingdom through V-E Day. Its
seven sections are arranged chronologically. The photographs were
selected and the text written by Capt. Kenneth E. Hunter; the editing
was done by Miss Mary Ann Bacon. The written text has been kept to a
minimum. The appendixes give information as to the abbreviations used
and the sources of the photographs.</p>

<p>The build-up of the United States Army in the United Kingdom, from
January 1942 until June 1944, with the huge amounts of supplies
necessary to equip and maintain the forces and to prepare for the
invasion of northern Europe was a tremendous undertaking. It involved
the transportation of men and supplies across the Atlantic during a
time when the German submarine menace was at its peak. The United
States Navy played a vital role in transporting men and supplies and
in protecting the convoys while en route. During this period the
administrative task was enormous since facilities for quartering and
training such large forces and for storing supplies and equipment
had to be provided within the limited area of the United Kingdom.
In October 1942 some of the units stationed in the United Kingdom
were sent to the Mediterranean for the invasion of North Africa. The
build-up continued after this, well-trained units arriving from the
United States. As the time for the invasion of France approached,
battle-tested units from the Mediterranean theater were transferred
to England to prepare for their part in the assault. In spite of
the limited terrain available, large-scale maneuvers and realistic
amphibious operations were conducted. In the early spring of 1944 joint
exercises of the ground, sea, and air forces which were to make the
attack in Normandy were held along the southern coast of England. The
last of these exercises was held in early May, the units then moving to
the staging areas and embarkation points for the invasion.</p>

<p>While the ground forces were being equipped and trained the Allied
air forces bombed the fortress of Europe. The Royal Air Force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> Bomber
Command carried out the air assault by night and the United States
Eighth Air Force by day. The first U. S. participation in the bombing
of Europe from British bases was on 4 July 1942, when American crews
flew six British bombers. During the fall of 1942 the Eighth Air Force
prepared the Twelfth Air Force for the invasion of Africa, and it was
not until the beginning of 1943 that U. S. bombers began to attack
Europe from England in large-scale raids. From that time on the attacks
on Germany continued with increasing intensity and shattering power
until, in February 1944, the German Luftwaffe attempted to sweep the
U. S. bombers from the skies over Europe. After a battle of one week’s
duration over important industrial cities of Germany, the Luftwaffe was
beaten and supremacy of the air was in Allied hands where it remained
until the end of the war.</p>

U. S. troops to cross the Atlantic after the declaration of war
by the United States went to Northern Ireland in January 1942.
In the same month the Special Observer Group was replaced by
Headquarters, United States Armed Forces in the British Isles.
Shortly thereafter the center of concentration was transferred
from Ireland to England and the rapid build-up of personnel
commenced. Logistical planning began in April 1942. This
build-up of men and supplies was to become one of the greatest
logistical undertakings in military history. Supplies were
shipped from the United States in ever increasing quantities
until, during the month of June 1944, approximately 1,000,000
long tons were received in the United Kingdom.</p>

advance party for the first contingent. By 1 June 1944 there
were 1,562,000 U. S. troops in the United Kingdom. During the
early months after the United States’ entry into World War II a
large part of the equipment was similar to that of World War I.
In the succeeding months much was done to improve all types of
equipment and many of the changes may be seen in the pictures
that follow in this volume.</p>

States members of the U. S. armed forces normally had completed
their training, but to keep the men at the peak of their
fighting fitness programs in firing, field exercises, and
special problems were begun under varying weather and terrain
conditions. Men in their late teens or early twenties made the
finest soldiers as they had stamina and recuperative power
far beyond that of older men. This physical superiority often
determined the issue in heavy and prolonged fighting.</p>

joined six RAF crews in a daylight attack against four airdromes

accompanied by four RAF Spitfire fighter squadrons, attacked the
marshalling yards at Rouen, France, and successfully completed
the first U. S. attack over Europe. From these small beginnings
the number of planes taking part in the raids grew until the
average per raid in 1943 was 570 heavy bombers, a figure that
was to be almost doubled in 1944.</p>

submarine construction yards and bases, (2) aircraft industry,
(3) ball-bearing industry, (4) oil industry, (5) synthetic
rubber plants, and (6) military transport vehicle industry. The
Schweinfurt raid had considerable significance at this time
because the Americans were still trying to prove the feasibility
of daylight precision bombing. This crucial raid was made by a
force of 228 heavy bombers and there ensued one of the greatest
battles in Eighth Air Force history. From the German frontier
at Aachen, where the fighter escort had to leave the bombers
because of limited gasoline capacities, to Schweinfurt and

Only fast low-level ships, such as the British Spitfire or the
U. S. P-47 or P-51, were good at this type of pursuit since the
robot bombs averaged well over 300 miles per hour. These bombs,
launched from sites along the invasion coast of France and the
Low Countries, caused considerable damage in England and in
addition were a demoralizing factor in that one never knew when
or where they would strike. The launching sites were placed
on the list of targets for the Allied air forces, but because
these sites could be easily moved and camouflaged they were
not completely destroyed until the invasion forces took over
the areas in which they were located. The first of the V-bombs
appeared over England on 13 June 1944.</p>

it was an important morale factor for men stationed away from
home. During the last week of May 1944 an artificial delay of
ten days was imposed on the forwarding of all American mail to
the United States and elsewhere, and the use of transatlantic
telephone, radio, and cable facilities was denied to American
personnel. British mail was strictly censored by the military
authorities from April 1944 until the invasion on 6 June 1944.
These precautionary measures were taken to assure the secrecy
of the coming invasion. In addition, a block was also placed on
diplomatic correspondence of all countries except the United

unvented openings with tape and sealing compound to render the

of any waterproofing equipment which might interfere with
satisfactory operation of the vehicles when on shore. These
methods were first successfully used in the invasion of North
Africa in November 1942. All vehicles which were to be driven
ashore in Normandy under their own power, through water, and in
the face of enemy fire, were waterproofed. Ordnance inspectors

<h2 class="small p2">SECTION II<br />
<span class="subhed">Normandy Campaign</span></h2></div>

<p>On 6 June 1944 the Allied military forces invaded northern France.
After long study of the German strength, including coastal defenses
and the disposition of enemy troops, the Allied commanders selected
the beaches along the Bay of the Seine for the assault landings. The
two beaches to be used by troops of the First U. S. Army were given
the names of Utah and Omaha. Those on which the British and Canadians
of the British Second Army were to land were named <span class="smcap">Gold</span>,
<span class="smcap">Sword</span>, and <span class="smcap">Juno</span>. The assault began at 0200 on 6
June when airborne troops were dropped behind the beaches with the
mission of securing exits from the beaches. Planes of the Allied air
force bombed the coastal defenses and shortly after sunrise the Navy
began shelling the beach defenses. At 0630 the first troops landed on
the beaches of Normandy. The sea was rough and the assault forces met
varying degrees of enemy opposition, but the beachheads were secured
and the assault and follow-up troops moved on to accomplish their
missions. The U. S. forces landing on Utah Beach moved northwest to
clear the northern portion of the Cotentin Peninsula and capture the
port of Cherbourg. Those landing on Omaha Beach advanced southward
toward Saint-Lô. The troops of the British Second Army were to advance
in a southeast direction from Caen.</p>

<p>The enormous build-up of men and material began immediately after the
assault. This operation was made most difficult because of the lack
of port facilities, but before the invasion plans had been made for
the construction of artificial harbors. The plans were quickly put
into effect and the harbors were almost completed when a summer gale
struck the Channel coast destroying most of the construction work. By
using amphibian trucks and Rhino ferries, and by drying out LST’s, the
build-up over open beaches progressed much faster than was anticipated
and men and supplies were poured into France in ever increasing
numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>While the beachheads were expanded and the build-up continued, the
infantry and armored units fought their way through the hedgerow
country toward their objectives. The fighting was slow and costly
as enemy opposition stiffened in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent
the Allied advance. With the capture of Cherbourg and Saint-Lô the
initial missions of the U. S. forces were completed and the forces
were then assembled in preparation for the drives south and west from
the beachhead toward Avranches and the Brittany Peninsula. The British
forces were to push southward from Caen exploiting in the direction of
Paris and the Seine Basin. These attacks were scheduled to begin on 19
July 1944 but because of bad weather the supporting aerial assault was
delayed and the breakout of Normandy did not get under way until 25
July.</p>

Forces took up the air attacks and in the half hour before the
touchdown of the assault forces (from 0600 to 0630) 1,365 heavy
bombers dropped 2,746 tons of high explosives on the shore
defenses. This was followed by attacks by medium bombers, light
bombers, and fighter bombers. During the 24 hours of 6 June
Allied aircraft flew 13,000 sorties, and during the first 8
hours alone dropped 10,000 tons of bombs.</p>

installations along the invasion beaches the Allied sea armada
drew in toward the coast, preceded by its flotillas of mine
sweepers. Bad weather conditions and high seas had driven the
enemy surface patrol craft into their harbors, and the 100-mile
movement across the English Channel was unopposed. By 0300 the
ships had anchored in the transport areas some thirteen miles
off their assigned beaches, and the loading of troops into
landing craft and the forming of the assault waves for the dash
to the beaches began. At 0550 the heavy naval support squadrons
began a 45-minute bombardment which quickly silenced the major
coast-defense batteries.</p>

shallow beaches in the vicinity of Saint-Martin-de-Varreville
are backed by sand dunes that extend inland 150 to 1,000 yards.
Behind the sand dunes the low ground had been inundated for a
width of one to two miles, restricting travel from the beaches
to four easily defended causeways. Farther inland the Merderet
River, running parallel to the coast, and the Douve River, from
which the ground rises northward to the hills around Cherbourg,
restrict traffic to the established roads. Sainte-Mère-Eglise,
Saint-Sauveur, and Barneville are key points on the road nets
leading to Cherbourg. Southeast of Utah Beach the Douve and
Vire Rivers flow into the shallow, muddy Carentan estuary which
marked the boundary between VII and V Corps.</p>

<p>On 25 July 1944 the Allied forces fighting in Normandy were able to
begin the offensive to break out of Normandy and carry to the German
frontier. Preceding the ground attack planes of the Allied air forces
dropped more than 3,390 tons of bombs on enemy positions on a narrow
front in the vicinity of Saint-Lô. The air attack’s crushing power and
its paralyzing effect on the German forces opened the way for a rapid
and powerful drive by Allied armored and infantry units. Cities were
captured in quick succession and the enemy troops were forced to flee
in a disorderly retreat.</p>

<p>The armored spearheads led the way out the Brittany Peninsula which
was quickly occupied, with the exception of the fortresses of the port
cities which were to continue to fight until after the German borders
had been reached. While part of the U. S. forces were overrunning the
Brittany Peninsula, the major portion turned toward the east in the
direction of Paris, and British and Canadian troops moved southward
from Caen along the road to Falaise. The battle of the Falaise-Argentan
pocket was a disastrous defeat for the German forces who were trying to
prevent the Allies from moving eastward. During the fighting in this
area elements of two German armies were so disorganized and destroyed
that their effectiveness was greatly impaired.</p>

<p>Paris surrendered on 25 August and by the 27th all enemy resistance
ceased there. The advance continued toward the eastern borders of
France, where the Allies stopped their rapid drive, and though a few
further advances were made, 14 September 1944 found them consolidating
their positions along the Moselle River and northward in Belgium and
Holland. The major port cities of Le Havre and Antwerp, which were
badly needed by the Allies as ports of entry for men and materials,
were captured.</p>

<p class="center p2">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>During the Northern France Campaign the expanding Allied forces
reorganized. The Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force,
moved to the Continent of Europe. The 21 Army Group was made up of the
British Second and the Canadian First Armies. The 12th Army Group,
composed of the First and Third U. S. Armies, became operational. In
August 1944 Allied forces invaded southern France and moved northward
to join those in northern France. This force, made up of the U. S.
Seventh and French First Armies, made a junction with the northern
group on 11 September. Also during this period the U. S. Ninth Army
became operational and took over the reduction of the Brittany
fortresses.</p>

First U. S. Army was to exert strong pressure and harass any
attempted enemy withdrawal. Marigny was taken on 26 July and,

Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), was

was that of supplying the racing armored columns since the only
points of entry were the beaches and Cherbourg, a distance too
far removed from the Allied forces advancing to the German
frontier. By early September supply trucks were traveling 600 to
900 miles in round trips to carry fuel, ammunition, and rations

made on the northern front. On 4 September the British forces
captured the port city of Antwerp, one of the greatest prizes
of the war. On 12 September the city of Le Havre surrendered.
These two cities were of extreme importance because of their
port facilities and their nearness to the battle front. In both
harbors the enemy had carried out measures to render the ports
useless, but they were not too badly damaged to prevent repair.</p>

</h2></div>

<p>On 15 September 1944 the Allied forces that had invaded southern France
came under control of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary
Force. This added the 6th Army Group to the forces opposing the enemy
along the German frontier, making a total of forty-eight Allied
divisions in the European Theater of Operations. In a little over three
months, 6 June-15 September 1944, the Western Allies had carried their
offensives from the Normandy beaches to the western borders of Germany.
During the next three months little, if any, progress was made. Several
factors contributed to this general slowdown. As fall and winter
approached, rain, mud, and snow greatly hindered operations and made
living conditions extremely trying. The terrain became more difficult
since many rivers and streams had to be crossed and rough, wooded, and
hilly country was encountered. Enemy resistance stiffened as the Allies
reached the German border. But more important than any other single
factor was the problem of supplying the large forces which had advanced
so rapidly that they had outrun their supplies.</p>

<p>During this period, as the Allies came to the West Wall and the Rhine,
severe fighting took place all along the front. Some of the most
difficult operations of the war in western Europe occurred during the
Rhineland Campaign as battles were fought in the Arnhem area, the
Schelde estuary, the Huertgen Forest, the Aachen sector, the Metz and
Saar regions, and the Belfort and Saverne Gaps. On 15 December the
efforts of the Allies in the Rhineland were interrupted when the enemy
broke through the lines in the Ardennes, causing a shift of troops to
the Ardennes to reinforce the lines there.</p>

was made to employ the greatest strength in the north to attain
flanking bridgeheads across the lower Rhine River beyond the
main fortifications of the West Wall. This area was chosen
for the drive since the terrain to the south was considered
unsuitable for a rapid advance because of the mountainous and
forested country.</p>

and glider landings were effective and in most cases were
made in the prescribed areas. During the following ten days
the fighting was severe with repeated German counterattacks.
However, the railroad bridge across the Waal River in the
Nijmegen area was captured on 20 September and remained in
Allied hands. By the end of September the corridor was widened
somewhat and the operation was considered a success even though
the Allies were forced to evacuate most of the attacking troops
after numerous casualties were suffered.</p>

hindered by rain and floods which canceled the heavy air support
and made the advance difficult for the ground forces. The attack
started on 8 November with only artillery support and it was
not until 22 November that the city was finally clear of all
enemy pockets of resistance. The last of the forts which ringed
the city was taken on 13 December. The Third Army was then
confronted by one of the strongest sections of the West Wall,
and since its reduction would require a vast amount of artillery
support, the attacks were suspended until the necessary
ammunition could be brought up.</p>

<span class="subhed">Ardennes-Alsace Campaign</span></h2></div>

<p>In mid-December 1944 the Allies stopped along the German border,
but continued to attack in the Saar and Roer regions, while they
concentrated the majority of their strength for an attack in the north.
The Germans, taking advantage of their continuous front along the
West Wall, planned a counterattack to strike the Allies in one of the
weakest portions of the line&mdash;the Ardennes sector. The ultimate goals
of this German operation were to capture the port city of Antwerp,
sever the major Allied supply lines emanating from that port, and
destroy the Allied forces north of the Antwerp-Brussels-Bastogne line.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of 16 December the German armies struck the
Allied troops located in Belgium and Luxembourg. The Allies holding
this portion of the line were too thinly dispersed to offer any great
resistance against the powerful enemy attack and were forced to fall
back. While the defenders fought the Germans, Allied armies shifted
their drives and troops were rushed to the Ardennes to reinforce the
hard hit units along the front from Monschau to Echternach. After
severe fighting during late December 1944 and early January 1945 the
Germans were defeated and by 25 January the Allies were once more
ready to move toward Germany through the West Wall defenses. During
the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign winter set in and the cold weather and
snow-covered terrain made operations and living conditions extremely
difficult.</p>

<p>During this period the British forces in the north eliminated the
Germans in the Roermond triangle and captured the enemy bridgehead west
of the Roer River. The U. S. and French troops of the 6th Army Group
fought a determined enemy in Lorraine and Alsace and by 25 January had
driven the attacking Germans back across the Moder River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span></p>

<p>The Ardennes-Alsace Campaign, which delayed the Rhineland Campaign
for six weeks, secured no major terrain objectives for either side.
The Germans, who had employed some of their best remaining units,
lost nearly 250,000 men, 600 tanks and assault guns, and about 1,600
airplanes. The Allies suffered 72,000 casualties.</p>

<p>On 6 January 1945 the Fifteenth U. S. Army became operational on the
Continent and was assigned to the 12th Army Group, taking over many of
that army group’s responsibilities in the rear areas.</p>

this was the opportunity to destroy the Allied troops in the
west. At 0530 on 16 December 1944 three German armies attacked
on a 50-mile front in eastern Belgium and northern Luxembourg.
This battle was popularly known as the Battle of the Bulge.</p>

but the drive by the enemy met with stiff resistance and he was
forced to commit his armor before noon on 16 December. Further
attacks in the northern sector were no more successful and by
night the Germans were still fighting at the approaches to the
Elsenborn Ridge.</p>

defeat the Allies. South of the Elsenborn Ridge in the vicinity
of the Losheim Gap U. S. troops were overwhelmed and forced to
withdraw. By evening the enemy, though blocked in the north, had
broken through the thinly held American line and drove toward
Stavelot and Huy, the first objective on the Meuse River. Still
further to the south in the Echternach area, the U. S. forces
stopped the enemy after he had made limited gains. The Allied

of December 1944 the main effort in Third Army zone was
concentrated in the vicinity of Bastogne, while the situation
in the rest of the army area remained static. Armored and
infantry attacks achieved small gains during which many German
counterattacks were made. Echternach was re-entered on 29
December and all enemy forces south of the Sauer River were
cleared. The armored divisions continued to advance. One, in
repulsing several counterattacks, suffered heavy casualties. On
3 January 1945 the last German attack was made on Bastogne. It
was unsuccessful.</p>

(Sarreguemines-Bitche-Lembach-Hatten-Sessenheim) and a final
defensive position along the eastern slope of the Vosges. On 1
January 1945 the Germans attacked in the area between Sarre and
Rohrbach and drove ten miles into the U. S. lines, where the
appearance of powerful armored reserves of the U. S. forces and
Allied counterattacks caused the enemy to curtail its operation.
Another New Year’s Day attack by the Germans in the Bitche area
was a more serious threat. After stubborn fighting on the part
of the Allied troops the attack spent itself on 7 January. In
the Bitche salient the fighting continued until 20 January
before becoming stabilized.</p>

26 January–21 March 1945</h2></div>

<p>At the successful conclusion of the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign the Allies
again turned their attention to the Rhineland. Between 26 January and
21 March a major objective was achieved: the German troops which tried
to halt the advance were cut off and destroyed, thus eliminating future
enemy action west of the Rhine.</p>

<p>When the Rhineland Campaign ended the Allied Expeditionary Force
numbered over 4,000,000 men organized into a well-balanced military
machine, with combat elements ready to strike the final blow against
the disintegrating enemy forces. On 21 March 1945 the First U. S. Army
held a bridgehead across the Rhine about twenty miles wide and eight
miles deep and had six divisions on the eastern bank of the river,
while the remaining Allied troops were prepared to cross in their
respective zones.</p>

capture of this bridge was an unexpected windfall, because the
retreating enemy troops had placed charges and were to blow the
bridge at 1600 on 7 March. The first U. S. troops reached the
bridge at 1550 and as the first charges began to explode army
engineers cut the wires to the others. Thus the bridge, while
damaged, was still intact and enabled the U. S. forces to cross

<p>The Central Europe Campaign began on 22 March 1945 with units of the
First U. S. Army across the Rhine in the Remagen area. On the night
of 22–23 March elements of the Third U. S. Army crossed the river
at Oppenheim. As the First and Third Armies crossed the Rhine the
Fifteenth U. S. Army took over the area west of the river from Bonn
to Neuss. On 26 March the Seventh U. S. Army crossed the Rhine north
and south of Worms and, after meeting stiff resistance on the river
bank, broke through the enemy and quickly expanded the bridgehead. The
Ninth U. S. Army crossed the river south of Wesel while the British
Second Army crossed north of the city. Elements of the First Allied
Airborne Army dropped east of the Rhine and linked up with the ground
troops east of the river. In many respects this was the most successful
airborne operation that had been carried out up to this time.</p>

<p>After the Allies were firmly established east of the Rhine the great
German industrial area of the Ruhr was encircled and the defending
troops captured. The advance through Germany was rapid and met with
little opposition except in scattered areas. The Russians drove into
Germany from the east and enemy troops in trying to escape capture
by the Russians surrendered by the thousands to the western Allies.
As the U. S., British, and Canadian troops in the north reached the
line where it was expected they would meet the Russian forces, they
halted. The Third and Seventh U. S. Armies continued their drives into
Czechoslovakia and Austria where a junction was also made with the
Russians.</p>

<p>On 2 May 1945 the German forces in Italy surrendered. Two days later
elements of the Seventh U. S. Army met those of the Fifth U. S. Army,
coming from Italy, at the Brenner Pass. On 9 May 1945 the surrender of
all the German forces became effective, marking the end of the war in
Europe.</p>

By noon on 25 March a second treadway bridge was completed.
The crossing of the Rhine in the Third Army area gained
complete tactical surprise and the enemy offered only scattered
resistance. By the evening of 24 March three divisions held a
bridgehead ten miles wide and nine miles deep. These divisions
were closely followed by two more, making a total of five on the
east bank of the Rhine.</p>

in two, and prisoners arrived in such large numbers that Allied

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
